<< Changes since the ps2str version 1.00>>

<< ps2strw.exe (Version 1.08) >> =======================================
- Features to set loop start and loop end block addresses during SPU 
  encoding process have been added.

- When audio data of stereo was converted into ads, the size of L/R for 
  interleave was fixed to 32 bytes. Now other sizes have been available. 

<< Version 1.05 >> =====================================================

- It has been changed to enable to multiplex the variable bit rate of the 
  MPEG2 video materials.

- For the PSS multiplexing process, the output file size has been reduced
  by making not to output the padding packet for the rate adjustment.

- The culculating method of SCR time stamp has been changed.

- The placement of the packets on multiplexing the MPEG video stream has 
  been changed to place according to the order of stream time stamping.

- The conversion from M2V to IPU has been changed in order to enable the 
  conversion even with the macroblock_stuffing code.

- In the file information screen, it has been changed to display the 
  input file name.

- The size of the information display window became indeterminate 
  sometimes. This problem has been fixed.

- The conversion from M2V to IPU sometimes did not finish if the invalid
  data was input. This problem has been fixed.

- The change has been made to set the delay time on the multiplexing for
  the arbitrary elementary stream.

- The permission for creating a new file has been changed from 0600 to 
  0666.

- The change has been made to display the stream type on PSS information 
  screen.

- The information display has been changed to output into a separate 
  window.

- In the multiplexing process, there was an output of fault program stream
  rate. This problem has been fixed. 
  (With this change, the program stream rate of the PSS data produced by 
  ver1.00 has a display of a different value (50 times more) from ver1.05.
  This has no effect on the decoding process.) 

< Change to the document>
- In the ipustream.doc document, a typo, MABI has been corrected to MBAI.
