Notes on Hardware
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EE and GS chips mounted on DTL-T10000 and DTL-H10000 have the following
restrictions.  Take note for the use of the following features.

For the latest information, please refer to the Developer Support Website.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Restrictions on EE 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Improper VIF0/VIF1-Related INTC Interrupts by the i Bit of VIFcode

   Unnecessary VIF0/VIF1-related INTC interrupts by the i bit of VIFcode 
   may occur under specific conditions. 

   [Workaround]
    When using an interrupt by the i bit of VIFcode, please take the steps 
    below.
    - SYNC instructions (MSCALL, MSCNT, FLUSH, FLUSHE, and FLUSHA) must be 
      directly followed by a NOP instruction.
    - Instructions with the i bit set must be directly preceded by a NOP 
      instruction.

2. Problem with the VU1 Microinstruction XGKICK

   When the E bit is set in the Upper instruction field of XGKICK, 
   the VIFcode FLUSH that waits for the end of the transfer may be 
   cancelled at unexpected timing.  
   
   [Workaround]
    Please do not set the E bit in the Upper instruction field of XGKICK.
    (This problem is avoidable by inserting a NOP instruction to move 
     the E bit.)

3. Debugging Functions (Hardware Breakpoint etc.)

    The following indefinite points and restrictions have been found.
  
    - In the strict sense, the data value breakpoint of the hardware
      breakpoint and the performance counter do not always stop at
      the accurate position in the Program Counter. 

    -  There are cases that the program does not function properly 
       when the address breakpoint of the hardware breakpoint is
       set to the sync instruction. 
       There is also a case that hardware breakpoint exception
       occurs in the data value breakpoint even though the condition
       differs from the setting.

4. Setting Drain Channel of MFIFO

    If the ring buffer address of the MFIFO is changed during DMA
    operation via the Drain Channel of the MFIFO, the operation
    becomes unstable occasionally. Therefore, do not change the
    ring buffer address while data is being transferred via the
    Drain Channel. 

5. DMA-tag Mismatch Error in VIF

    A DMA mismatch error may occur in the setting of VIFn_ERR.ME0=
    0 (DAM-tag mismatch error mask disable), even if a correct packet
    is sent to the VIF.

    < Action >
	Set as VIFn_ERR.ME0 = 1.
	
6. Simultaneous Transfer of ch1 and ch9 of DMAC

    Transfer may stall if the toSPR and toVPU1 source chain modes are
    executed simultaneously, in the case of TTE of toSPR = 0 and
    TTE of toVPU1 = 1.
    

    < Action >
	Avoid activating the above conditioned DMAs at the same time.

7. Divide Instructions of COP1 (FPU) and COP2 (VU0) 

    The following problems occur due to the FDIV (floating-point
    divider) malfunction of the inner EE.
    
    With the following instructions, the incorrect value may be 
    returned in some cases:

    COP1 (FPU) divide instructions   DIV.S, SQRT.S, RSQRT.S
    COP2 (VU0) divide instructions   DIV, SQRT, RSQRT, VDIV, VSQRT, VRSQRT
    
    < Action >
    The above problem can be avoided by not locating the divide 
    instructions in the following points:

       1. Two steps of the branch destination instructions
       2. Three steps following the branch instruction (including
	  the branch delay slot)
       3. One step instruction immediately after the SYNC.P 
       4. The first two steps of the VU0 micro code

    < Countermeasures >
       
       Software:
       For the C/C++ program:
       As for developing with the C/C++ language, we are currently fixing
       GNU tools to generate the code which avoids hardware malfunctions.

       For the assembler:
       Please take the above action to avoid restrictions remained in the
       program with developing with assemblers.

8. Initialization of DMAC
     
       When executing DMA transfer with normal mode or interleave mode,
       if DMA is kicked (set to Dn_CHCR.STR =1) in a state of Dn_QWC = 0
       is 0, the transfer is not performed properly.
       That is:
	
       // the following codes are not operated properly
       // (the operation becomes unstable depending on the condition)


    // Normal Mode 
    Dn_CHCR.MOD = 0;	// Normal Mode
    Dn_QWC      = 0;	// Number of transfer word = 0
    Dn_CHCR.STR = 1;	// Starts DMA transfer 

    // Interleave Mode 
    Dn_CHCR.MOD = 2;	// Interleave Mode
    Dn_QWC      = 0;	// Number of transfer word = 0
    Dn_CHCR.STR = 1;	// Starts DMA transfer

    < Action >
    Do not activate DMA in the Dn_QWC = 0 setting.

    This limitation remains in the final specification.

9. Short Loop of 5 Steps or Less 

     The branch prediction may be incorrect with the very short loop
     which is 5 steps or less (6 steps or less including the branch
     instruction).  For example, if there is no hazard in l0-a, l1-a,
     l0-b and l1-b of the following loops (a WAIT cycle occurrence due
     to a cache error etc.), the branch condition becomes incorrect
     in rare cases. 
     

     label:    l0-a			// Instruction of l0 pipe
	       l1-a			// Instruction of l1 pipe
	       l0-b			// Instruction of l0 pipe
	       l1-b			// Instruction of l1 pipe
	       branch taget=label	// Branch to label address
	       l1-c			// Instruction of l1 pipe

     Example:
               addiu	$a1,$a1,1
	       addiu	$v1,$v1,4
	       addu	$s0,$s0,$a1
	       slti	$v0,$a1,80
	       bnez	$v0,20 <c+0x20>
	       sw	$s0,0($v1)
    
    < Action >
      For the C/C++ program:
      ee-as has been fixed in Release 1.3. to add the appropriate
      number of nop immediately before the conditional branch
      instruction when necessary.

      For the assembler:
      Do not use the loop of 5 steps or less (6 steps including the
      branch instruction - including the branch delay slot)

10. Access to VU Mem Mapped to Main Memory Space

     The feature enabling the EE Core to access the VU Mem mapped in
     main memory space is provided only for debugging purposes.
     Therefore, its operation is not guaranteed for accesses made while
     the VU is operating.

     If data written to VU Mem by the store instruction of the EE Core
     is used by a VU macroinstruction (COP2 instruction) immediately,
     there is no guarantee that the write operation is completed by 
     the time the macroinstruction is issued, because the store
     instruction writes the data via the write buffer.  In this case,
     the access is made while the VU is operating (macro instruction)
     and may result in malfunction.

     This problem is avoidable by inserting the sync.I instruction
     between the store instruction and the macroinstruction.

11. EE Memory Controller Bug with DTL-T10000(H)

    In extremely rare circumstances, memory may not be accessed 
    normally on the DTL-T10000(H).  This problem will not occur either 
    on the debugging station or on an actual unit.
    Although it is difficult to avoid this problem at the application 
    level, the bug can be avoided by switching the workaround ON 
    on dsedb.  However, the memory access / DMA transfer performance for 
    memory beyond 32M bytes is generally reduced, when the workaround is 
    switched ON.  Therefore, the workaround is switched OFF in default 
    setting.

       (How to switch the workaround ON)
      - Reset the EE parameter (set to "1") using the dsedb reset command.
          dsedb> reset 1 0
      - Specify the -ebootp option when starting dsedb from the shell
          % dsedb -ebootp 1 -r run prog.elf

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Restrictions on GS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Depth Test

    When the ZTE which controls the depth test is ON/OFF switched,
    the test may not be performed properly in some conditions.

    Therefore, if you are not executing the depth test nor using the 
    Z buffer, do not set as ZTE=0 but set as ZTE=1 and ZTST=01(Always).
    At the same time, set the ZBUF register as ZMSK=1.
    The GS internal operation in this state is equivalent to the ZTE=0
    state.

2.The Interrupt from the GS to the EE
 
    SIGNAL, FINISH, HSync and VSync are various causes of interrupt
    from the GS to the EE.  While the interrupt handler is in the
    process for the interrupt from the GS, if additional interrupt
    from the GS occurs, the EE may fail to receive the second and
    the following interrupts depending on the description of the
    interrupt handler.  
    
    < Measures >

    To prevent this from happening, the GS interrupt mask register 
    is to be in the masked state while the GS interrupt is being handled.

	u_long UserIMR;

	// Masks all interrupts.
	UserIMR = sceGsPutIMR(0xff00);

	// Branches according to the individual cause of interrupts

	// Clears causes of interrupts

	// Processes corresponding to interrupts

	// Cancels the interrupt mask 
	sceGsPutIMR(UserIMR);

    The above process is unnecessary for the interrupts of start  
    and termination of V-Blank since they are input to the EE as 
    different interrupts from the GS interrupt described above.

3. Texture Width

    When transferring textures to GS local memory, expand the restriction
    on texture width corresponding to the texel format in use, as shown 
    below.

        Texel Format           		Texture Width

	PSMCT32                		Multiple of 2 Pixels
	PSMCT24		       		Multiple of 8 Pixels
	PSMCT16, 16S           		Multiple of 4 Pixels
	PSMT8, 8H, PSMT4, 4HH, 4HL	Multiple of 8 Pixels

    If a transfer is performed without meeting the above restrictions,
    a part of the data may not be written correctly in some rare cases due 
    to GS incompatibility. The value that had been previously written 
    remains in the PIXEL where the data writing failed. (between 1 to 
    several pixels, in general). There will be no offset of the transfer 
    position due to the writing failure.

    < Measures >

    When transferring textures to GS local memory, always execute 
    the transfer using a format that satisfies the above restrictions.
