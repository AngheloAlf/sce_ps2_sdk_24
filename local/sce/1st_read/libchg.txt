  been added.
  (*)
  If you wish to use this function in your titles, please contact SCEI 
  for further details.

< Network Configuration GUI Library >
- Libraries such as header file, related to the network configuration 
  GUI library are not contained in this release. They will be released 
  as a separate package after the version 2.5 is released.

< libnet Libraries >
- As of theis release, libnet sample programs are released as libraries. 
  Configuration of the libraries and source files is as follows:

  Libraries:			        Source files:
  ee/lib/libnet.a			ee/src/lib/libnet
  iop/modules/libnet.irx		iop/src/modules/libnet

< EE Kernel >
[Change of eekernel.h ]
- The argument type of the member, entry in ThreadParam structure has 
  been changed according to the reference document, which has the 
  correct indication.

  Note:
  Due to this change, there may be a case that you require modifying 
  the type of the function pointer to be substituted in the entry.

[ app.cmd ]
- The failure that cannot link in C++ language has been fixed. 

  Note:
  With the former compiler, Tool Chain EE 2.9-ee-991111-01, note that 
  the app.cm file cannot be linked.

  To prevent this, change the commands as follows:

  KEEP (*EXCLUDE_FILE (*crtend.o) .ctors)) --> KEEP (*(.ctors))
  KEEP (*EXCLUDE_FILE (*crtend.o) .dtors)) --> KEEP (*(.dtors))
 
< IOP Kernel >
- Note that CpuDisableIntr() and CpuEnableIntr() functions released in
  intrman.h up to and including Release 2.4.3 are old functions, 
  therefore, they cannot be used hereafter. 
  
  New functions equivalent to the above are CpuSuspendIntr() and 
  CpuResumeIntr(), respectively. Be sure to replace them accordingly.

  Due to the change of intrman.h, an error occurs in case the deleted 
  functions mentioned above are used in the applications. 
  In such a case, we recommend you include introld.h provided as a 
  tentative measure. Error does not occur in the existing program, 
  which has already been compiled.
 
  However, the introld.h will be deleted before the next release is
  introduced, for being a tentative version. Be reminded to use 
  the new functions.
  
< CSL MIDI Sequencer (modmidi) >
- "Marking function" that calls callback function by using NRPN in the 
  sequence data (SQ) has been added. Along with this change, new 
  members; markCallBack and  markCallBackPrivateData have been added to 
  sceMidiEnv structure. Note that all the files refer to modmidi.h must 
  be re-compiled.

- Make sure to use the flash t10000-rel250.bin for developing the
  programs with the use of libraries in the Release 2.5. Also, use 
  ioprp250.img to replace the IOP default modules.
  For the details of the module replacement, refer to SIF system 
  (sif.pdf) or [Tech Notes] on the Developer Support Web site.

< Notes on the use of Release 2.5 flash >
  The following message appears when terminating the program. However, 
  this does not cause any problem.
 
  "# TLB spad=0 kernel=1:12 default=13:36 extended=37:47"

- Since the use of an986.irx in titles is prohibited (See [Tech Notes] 
  on the Developer Support Web site as of Nov. 22, 2000 for details)
  an986.irx is not included under sce/iop/modules in the release
  package. The an986.irx can be downloaded from the Developer Support
  Web site.

- To use USB modem drivers, we recommend you obtain the driver provided 
  by the Tools & Middleware licensees by downloading from the Developer
  Support Web site.

- In some cases, it may take minutes for the USB Ethernet adapter
  to be recognized after replacing with a different adaptor.
  If the adapter do not work properly, and it is not due to a hardware
  problem, please contact SCE.

- The field, content_length that represents the same length has been 
  added to sceHTTPResponse structure.  

- As an option at transaction, if sceHTTPO_HashCB and sceHTTPO_HashSize 
  were added and call back function has already been set, this call back 
  function can be called back each time the number of transferred byte 
  during the transaction exceeds the byte previously set.

- With libhttp, the type that represents time, sceHTTPTime_t has been 
  defined as 64-bit integer.

- With libhttp, the type that represents content length, sceHTTPSize_t 
  has been defined as 64-bit signed integer.    

- The type of length field in sceHTTPResponse structure has been changed 
  to sceHTTPSize_t.

- For case when transaction is executed with GET method, the function 
  has been added, which enables to receive contents addressed to files, 
  not to memory, with file descriptor and file write function.

- For case when timeout or abort occurs in user setting during data 
  transfer, the returned value has been fixed so that sceHTTPRequest() 
  returns -1.

- With sceHTTPSetOption(), using sceHTTPO_ClientName to set client name 
  can cause invalid memory to be freed in the library. This problem has 
  been fixed.

- In the state with no connection with the server, an error does not 
  occur even if sceHTTPRequest() function is called. This problem has 
  been fixed.

- A modification has been made: user can use client names as they are.
  
- A modification has been made to the library to prevent it from adding 
  Accept-Encoding header automatically.

- With sceHTTPSetOption(), a new mode has been added so that all of the 
  names can be deleted from the request header list, when 
  sceHTTPO_RequestHeaders option is specified and headers with the 
  same names as in the additional header list are contained in the 
  request header list.

- sceHTTPO_DelRequestHeader option has been added and so 
  sceHTTPSetOption() function can delete all the headers of the 
  specified names from the request header list.

- sceHTTPError_WRITEF has been added as an error number returned by 
  sceHTTPGetClientError() in case when an error occurs with a file 
  write function. 
 
- With sceHTTPSetCookie(), domain names cannot be checked incorrectly. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- With sceHTTPParseCookie(), an incorrect value is set in expires field 
  in the retrieved list element of sceHTTPCookie_t. This problem has 
  been fixed.
 
- With sceHTTPParseCookie(), a change has been made so that default 
  values of domain and path names can be processed. Along with this 
  change, the type of sceHTTPParseCookie() has been modified and 
  another change has been made to the pointer to be able to specify 
  HTTP client structure as the second argument.

- With sceHTTPAddCookieList(), a change has been made; 
  if sceHTTPCookie_t type elements with common variable, path, and 
  domain names exist, the elements can be overwritten instead of 
  adding new elements.

- With sceHTTPSetCookie(), a change has been made; when Cookie header 
  is created from the list of sceHTTPCookie_t type element, the list 
  can be sorted by path names.

- With sceHTTPSetCookie(), a change has been made so that the Cookie 
  header which is not defined in RFC2109 with linefeed cannot be output. 
  (this is to prevent a Cookie header not defined in RFC with linefeed 
  from being recognized as an invalid format in a part of HTTP server) 

- A part of response header cannot occasionally be retrieved. 
  This problem has been fixed.

< Change of netglue.h >
- __sceNetGlueErrnoLoc() and __sceNetGlueHErrnoLoc() were declared 
  outside of extern "C," however, a change has been made so that the
  functions can declare internally.

  (name) of sceInetName2Address() function.
  
DHCP related issues:
- The process which brings the interface "down" has been added for case
  when IP address retrieval is failed after the lease of DHCP expired.

- Queuing time until the first DHCP Discover message is sent has been 
  changed from "0.1 to 1.0" to "0.6 to 1.5." Also, a 30-second interval 
  of timeout has been changed to a 5-second interval before 30 seconds 
  elapses. (This is to support the Hub that cannot send/receive 
  immediately after Nego)

TCP related issues:
- The following changes have been made;

  ARP request retry interval:  	    "1 to 9" seconds --> One second
  No. of retry times:	 	    Two --> Four times
  Timeout in case of no response:   Three minutes --> 24 seconds

- With sceInetClose(), send/receive queue cannot be cleared when 
  terminating with TimeWait. This problem has been fixed.
 
- When the interface is "down," the connection with TimeWait cannot be 
  freed correctly. This problem has been fixed.

- With sceINETC_GET_INFO, the process which sets send buffer size to 
  send_queue_length has been added.

- With send/receive packets smaller than the maximum Segment Size, 
  the process that reduces the used internal memory has been added.

  occur in inet.irx even if sceInetClose() is executed for TCP 
  connection in the wait state. 

inet related issues:
- With TCP and UDP, receive packet to the port No. 0 is processed 
  incorrectly. This problem has been fixed.

- Addition process to ARP cache has been reviewed and then, a change 
  has been made so that cache entry can be updated by the ARP response 
  requested on its own. (This is effective only in the environment 
  that allows many broadcast packets to flow)

- With all timer processes used for resending TCP, etc., the process 
  speed can be decreased by a second at most. This problem has been 
  fixed. 

- The following control codes have been added to sceInetInterfaceControl(). 

   sceInetCC_GetIP_RxPackets
   sceInetCC_GetIP_TxPackets
   sceInetCC_GetIP_RxDropped
   sceInetCC_GetIP_TxDropped

- With sceInetSend() and sceInetSendTo(), the process which handles it 
  as an error with sceINETE_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES has been added for 
  case when the free space is less than 1/8 of the whole size.  

- With sceInetName2Address(), if the specified timeout is smaller 
  than 0, which also uses the default value, the value gets multiplied 
  to 1000-fold. This problem has been fixed.   

- The function which refers and modifies buffer sizes of TCP, UDP, and 
  RAW has been added. 

  Setting example: ceInetControl(code=sceINETC_CODE_{SET,GET}_{SND,RCV}BUF)

- Along with the addition of the function that supports IP multicast, 
  the following structure and control codes for sceInetControl() have 
  been added.

  Structure:

  added.

- A change has been made; when PAP and CHAP authentications have failed, 
  "AUTH failed" can be set in the status string which is retrieved with 
  scePPPCC_GetLastResultString and so, it would not be overwritten.

< inetctl.irx >
inetctl related issues:
- The following events have been added to notify event handlers.

  and after. This problem has been fixed. 

- getsockname() could not be executed for a listen socket. This problem 
  has been fixed.
 
- getsockname() and getpeername() did not return 0 under normal operating 
  conditions but accessed an undefined address. This problem has been 
  fixed.

  getsockname(), and getpeername() was too small. This problem has been 
  fixed.
  (To be more specific, this error occurs to a value lower than 
  sizeof(struct sockaddr_in). In the above case, the value specified for 
  the size judgment was 4 bytes.)

- Since memory for a new socket replenished by accept() was not fully 
  initialized, an unauthorized memory access was sometimes made. This 
  problem has been fixed. 

- There was a possibility that a socket ID for a new socket replenished by 
  accept() might be used in duplicate elsewhere. This problem has been 
  fixed.

  to verify cause of errors from the return values when terminated with 
  error.

  sceSdBlockTrans(), sceSdClearEffectWorkArea(), sceSdInit(),
  sceSdSetEffectAttr(), sceSdVoiceTrans(), and sceSdVoiceTransStatus(),

- With sceSdProcBatch() and sceSdProcBatchEx() functions, if SD_WRITE_EE 
  and SD_RETURN_EE were specified for the command, the data could not be 
  transferred correctly. This problem has been fixed.

- With sceSdBlockTrans() function, the following problems have been 
  resolved:

    * With a transfer channel in process of transferring, when an attempt 
      had been made to perform a transfer start processing (regardless of 
      WRITE/READ/WRITE_FROM) to the transferring channel by using 
      sceSdBlockTrans(), a negative value was returned to notify that the 
      channel was already in transferring process, which caused the 
      transfer state to be irregular.
  
    * When SD_TRANS_MODE_STOP was specified, the transfer did not stop 
      correctly.
  
    * When SD_TRANS_MODE_STOP was specified, the bit that represents a 
      buffer in transferring process could not be set in the return value 
      correctly.

- With sceSdBlockTransStatus(), the bit that represents a buffer in 
  transferring process could not be set in the return value correctly. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- With sceSdGetEffectAttr(), when each EVOL had been changed by using 
  sceSdSetEffectAttr() and sceSdSetParam(), depth_L and depth_R were 
  not returned correctly. This problem has been fixed.

- With sceSdVoiceTransStatus(), even if SD_TRANS_STATUS_WAIT had been 
  specified, multiple threads could not be waited. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- With sceSdBlockTrans() and sceSdVoiceTrans(), when SD_TRANS_MODE_READ
  was specified, the data that had been read from SPU2 local memory 
  could not be read correctly. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- A modification has been made; with sceSdVoiceTrans(), if SD_TRANS_BY_IO 
  is specified for the transfer device, the transfer can be performed by 
  the unit of 64 bytes.
  When both of SD_TRANS_BY_DMA and SD_TRANS_BY_IO are specified, data can 
  be transferred by the unit of 64 bytes (rounded up to 64-byte multiple).
 
Release 2.4.3
- If both CORE0 and CORE1 used an SPU2 interrupt, user's interrupt handler 
  might not be called. This problem has been fixed.
 
- sceSdInit() wrote data exceeding the reserved area in SPU2 local memory. 
  This problem has been fixed.
