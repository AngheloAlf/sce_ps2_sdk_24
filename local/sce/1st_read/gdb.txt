About GDB
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The GDB supports debugging of the programs running on the target 
hardware with limitations imposed from Release 0.3.0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Operating Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Activate the gdb.

  $ ee-gdb Program to be debugged

  When the command name is different from the name of GDB itself, 
  activation results in error "ide_initialize_paths failed".  In this 
  case, take steps to activate it; by using the complete path name of 
  the GDB, for example.  
  It is also possible to activate the GDB via the command line 
  interface by specifying the -nw option.

 2. Connect to the dsnetm with the target command.

  (gdb) target deci2
 
  If the machine, on which the dsnetm is running, is different from 
  the one, on which the gdb is running, specify the hostname the dsnetm 
  is operating with as well.

  (gdb) target deci2 hostname

3. Load the program to the target hardware with the load command.

  (gdb) load

4. Debug the program by using a command of the gdb.

5. To execute the program again after it has finished its execution, 
   execute the target command again, and then execute the reset 
   command and load command. 

  (gdb) target deci2
  (gdb) reset
  (gdb) load

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The GDB does not support the standard input.  Besides, it is not 
   intended to support the standard input in the future. 

2. As for the flash ROM image, the one released at the same time as 
   the GDB is necessary. 

3. The GDB does not support debugging of the VU1 program.  The other 
   simulator-specific functions cannot be used either (though their 
   operations seem useable). 

4. The program compiled by specifying the optimization option can 
   also be debugged.  In this case, however, it is possible that 
   the execution sequence of the program might seem different from 
   the source program and a line executed only once might seem to have 
   been executed twice or more.  The reason is that the execution 
   sequence is changed and machine instruction for one line is 
   distributed according to the optimization of the compiler.  
   Therefore, these symptoms are not bugs.

5. The GDB does not reset the target hardware on starting.  To use 
   the GDB immediately after the program is executed on the target 
   hardware, use the dsreset command, or activate the GDB, execute 
   the target command and use the reset command.
