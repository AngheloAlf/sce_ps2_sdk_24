Building and Installing ee-gcc Tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Normally, it is unnecessary to do the following.  Only when the tools 
under sce/ee/gcc do not operate normally depending on the OS version 
etc., do the following work according to the procedure below.  

The following are performed with the root authority. 

1. Decompressing Sources

	# cd /usr/local/sce/ee/gcc
	# mv src/src.tar.gz .
	# rmdir src
	# tar zxvf src.tar.gz 

	The "src.tar.gz" shown above is the one included in the latest 
        package.

2. Applying Patches

	# cd /usr/local/sce/ee/gcc
	# patch -p1 < sce-patch

3. Building Tools

	# cd /usr/local/sce/ee/gcc	
	# mkdir build
	# cd build
	# ../config.sh
	# make all
	# make install
	# cd gdb
	# make install-gdbtk
		
Note:
Building tools results in failure when the current directory '.' is 
included in the command search path.  Before building the tools, 
confirm '.' is not included in the environment variable path. 
Moreover, building the tools requires an empty capacity of about 
400MB at least in the hard disk.
