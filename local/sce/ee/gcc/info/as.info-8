   If you have contributed to `as' and your name isn't listed here, it
is not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to
the maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the
maintainer is Ken Raeburn (email address `raeburn@cygnus.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 processors
(tc-z8k, tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format
(obj-ieee), was written by Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve
also modified the COFF back end to use BFD for some low-level
operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g. `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made `as' able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"
architecture.

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the
various tic* flavors.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.
