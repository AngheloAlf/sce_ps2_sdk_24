Stack manipulation commands in GDB/MI
=====================================

The `-stack-info-frame' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-info-frame

   Get info on the current frame.

GDB Command
...........

   The corresponding GDB command is `info frame' or `frame' (without
arguments).

Example
.......

   N.A.

The `-stack-info-depth' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-info-depth [ MAX-DEPTH ]

   Return the depth of the stack.  If the integer argument MAX-DEPTH is
specified, do not count beyond MAX-DEPTH frames.

GDB Command
...........

   There's no equivalent GDB command.

Example
.......

   For a stack with frame levels 0 through 11:

     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 4
     ^done,depth="4"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 12
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 11
     ^done,depth="11"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 13
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)

The `-stack-list-arguments' Command
-----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-arguments SHOW-VALUES
         [ LOW-FRAME HIGH-FRAME ]

   Display a list of the arguments for the frames between LOW-FRAME and
HIGH-FRAME (inclusive).  If LOW-FRAME and HIGH-FRAME are not provided,
list the arguments for the whole call stack.

   The SHOW-VALUES argument must have a value of 0 or 1.  A value of 0
means that only the names of the arguments are listed, a value of 1
means that both names and values of the arguments are printed.

GDB Command
...........

   GDB does not have an equivalent command.  `gdbtk' has a
`gdb_get_args' command which partially overlaps with the functionality
of `-stack-list-arguments'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -stack-list-frames
     ^done,
     stack={
     frame={level="0 ",addr="0x00010734",func="callee4",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="8"},
     frame={level="1 ",addr="0x0001076c",func="callee3",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="17"},
     frame={level="2 ",addr="0x0001078c",func="callee2",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="22"},
     frame={level="3 ",addr="0x000107b4",func="callee1",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="27"},
     frame={level="4 ",addr="0x000107e0",func="main",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="32"}}
     (gdb)
     -stack-list-arguments 0
     ^done,
     stack-args={
     frame={level="0",args={}},
     frame={level="1",args={name="strarg"}},
     frame={level="2",args={name="intarg",name="strarg"}},
     frame={level="3",args={name="intarg",name="strarg",name="fltarg"}},
     frame={level="4",args={}}}
     (gdb)
     -stack-list-arguments 1
     ^done,
     stack-args={
     frame={level="0",args={}},
     frame={level="1",
      args={{name="strarg",value="0x11940 \"A string argument.\""}}},
     frame={level="2",args={
     {name="intarg",value="2"},
     {name="strarg",value="0x11940 \"A string argument.\""}}},
     {frame={level="3",args={
     {name="intarg",value="2"},
     {name="strarg",value="0x11940 \"A string argument.\""},
     {name="fltarg",value="3.5"}}},
     frame={level="4",args={}}}
     (gdb)
     -stack-list-arguments 0 2 2
     ^done,stack-args={frame={level="2",args={name="intarg",name="strarg"}}}
     (gdb)
     -stack-list-arguments 1 2 2
     ^done,stack-args={frame={level="2",
     args={{name="intarg",value="2"},
     {name="strarg",value="0x11940 \"A string argument.\""}}}}
     (gdb)

The `-stack-list-frames' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-frames [ LOW-FRAME HIGH-FRAME ]

   List the frames currently on the stack.  For each frame it displays
the following info:

`LEVEL'
     The frame number, 0 being the topmost frame, i.e. the innermost
     function.

`ADDR'
     The `$pc' value for that frame.

`FUNC'
     Function name.

`FILE'
     File name of the source file where the function lives.

`LINE'
     Line number corresponding to the `$pc'.

   If invoked without arguments, this command prints a backtrace for the
whole stack.  If given two integer arguments, it shows the frames whose
levels are between the two arguments (inclusive).  If the two arguments
are equal, it shows the single frame at the corresponding level.

GDB Command
...........

   The corresponding GDB commands are `backtrace' and `where'.

Example
.......

GDB/MI Variable Objects
=======================

Motivation for Variable Objects in GDB/MI
-----------------------------------------

   For the implementation of a variable debugger window (locals, watched
expressions, etc.), we are proposing the adaptation of the existing code
used by `Insight'.

   The two main reasons for that are:

  1. It has been proven in practice (it is already on its second
     generation).

  2. It will shorten development time (needless to say how important it
     is now).

   The original interface was designed to be used by Tcl code, so it was
slightly changed so it could be used through GDB/MI.  This section
describes the GDB/MI operations that will be available and gives some
hints about their use.

   *Note*: In addition to the set of operations described here, we
expect the GUI implementation of a variable window to require, at
least, the following operations:

   * `-gdb-show' `output-radix'

   * `-stack-list-arguments'

   * `-stack-list-locals'

   * `-stack-select-frame'

Introduction to Variable Objects in GDB/MI
------------------------------------------

   The basic idea behind variable objects is the creation of a named
object to represent a variable, an expression, a memory location or
even a CPU register.  For each object created, a set of operations is
available for examining or changing its properties.

   Furthermore, complex data types, such as C structures, are
represented in a tree format.  For instance, the `struct' type variable
is the root and the children will represent the struct members.  If a
child is itself of a complex type, it will also have children of its
own.  Appropriate language differences are handled for C, C++ and Java.

   When returning the actual values of the objects, this facility allows
for the individual selection of the display format used in the result
creation.  It can be chosen among: binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal
and natural.  Natural refers to a default format automatically chosen
based on the variable type (like decimal for an `int', hex for
pointers, etc.).

   The following is the complete set of GDB/MI operations defined to
access this functionality:

*Operation*            *Description*                               
`-var-create'          create a variable object                    
`-var-delete'          delete the variable object and its children 
`-var-set-format'      set the display format of this variable     
`-var-show-format'     show the display format of this variable    
`-var-info-num-children'tells how many children this object has     
`-var-list-children'   return a list of the object's children      
`-var-info-type'       show the type of this variable object       
`-var-info-expression' print what this variable object represents  
`-var-show-attributes' is this variable editable? does it exist    
                       here?                                       
`-var-evaluate-expression'get the value of this variable              
`-var-assign'          set the value of this variable              
`-var-update'          update the variable and its children        

   In the next subsection we describe each operation in detail and
suggest how it can be used.

Description And Use of Operations on Variable Objects
-----------------------------------------------------

The `-var-create' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-create {NAME | "-"}
         {FRAME-ADDR | "*"} EXPRESSION

   This operation creates a variable object, which allows the
monitoring of a variable, the result of an expression, a memory cell or
a CPU register.

   The NAME parameter is the string by which the object can be
referenced.  It must be unique.  If `-' is specified, the varobj system
will generate a string "varNNNNNN" automatically.  It will be unique
provided that one does not specify NAME on that format.  The command
fails if a duplicate name is found.

   The frame under which the expression should be evaluated can be
specified by FRAME-ADDR.  A `*' indicates that the current frame should
be used.

   EXPRESSION is any expression valid on the current language set (must
not begin with a `*'), or one of the following:

   * `*ADDR', where ADDR is the address of a memory cell

   * `*ADDR-ADDR' -- a memory address range (TBD)

   * `$REGNAME' -- a CPU register name

Result
......

   This operation returns the name, number of children and the type of
the object created.  Type is returned as a string as the ones generated
by the GDB CLI:

      name="NAME",numchild="N",type="TYPE"

The `-var-delete' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-delete NAME

   Deletes a previously created variable object and all of its children.

   Returns an error if the object NAME is not found.

The `-var-set-format' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-format NAME FORMAT-SPEC

   Sets the output format for the value of the object NAME to be
FORMAT-SPEC.

   The syntax for the FORMAT-SPEC is as follows:

      FORMAT-SPEC ==>
      {binary | decimal | hexadecimal | octal | natural}

The `-var-show-format' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-show-format NAME

   Returns the format used to display the value of the object NAME.

      FORMAT ==>
      FORMAT-SPEC

The `-var-info-num-children' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-num-children NAME

   Returns the number of children of a variable object NAME:

      numchild=N

The `-var-list-children' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-list-children NAME

   Returns a list of the children of the specified variable object:

      numchild=N,children={{name=NAME,
      numchild=N,type=TYPE},(repeats N times)}

The `-var-info-type' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-type NAME

   Returns the type of the specified variable NAME.  The type is
returned as a string in the same format as it is output by the GDB CLI:

      type=TYPENAME

The `-var-info-expression' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-expression NAME

   Returns what is represented by the variable object NAME:

      lang=LANG-SPEC,exp=EXPRESSION

where LANG-SPEC is `{"C" | "C++" | "Java"}'.

The `-var-show-attributes' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-show-attributes NAME

   List attributes of the specified variable object NAME:

      status=ATTR [ ( ,ATTR )* ]

where ATTR is `{ { editable | noneditable } | TBD }'.

The `-var-evaluate-expression' Command
--------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-evaluate-expression NAME

   Evaluates the expression that is represented by the specified
variable object and returns its value as a string in the current format
specified for the object:

      value=VALUE

The `-var-assign' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-assign NAME EXPRESSION

   Assigns the value of EXPRESSION to the variable object specified by
NAME.  The object must be `editable'.

The `-var-update' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-update {NAME | "*"}

   Update the value of the variable object NAME by evaluating its
expression after fetching all the new values from memory or registers.
A `*' causes all existing variable objects to be updated.

GDB/MI Draft Changes to Output Syntax
=====================================

   One problem identified in the existing GDB/MI output syntax was the
difficulty in differentiating between a tuple such as:

     {number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",enabled="y"}

   where each value has a unique label, and a list such as:

     {"1","2","4"}
     {bp="1",bp="2",bp="4"}

   where values are un-labeled or the label is duplicated.

   What follows is a draft revision to the output specification that
addresses this problem.

   The output from GDB/MI consists of zero or more out-of-band records
optionally followed by a single result record, the result record being
for the most recent command input.  The sequence is terminated by
`(gdb)'.

   Asynchronous GDB/MI output is similar.

   Each output record directly associated with an input command is
prefixed by the input command's `TOKEN'.

`OUTPUT ==>'
     { OUT-OF-BAND-RECORD } `[' RESULT-RECORD `]' "`(gdb)'" NL

`RESULT-RECORD ==>'
     `[' TOKEN `]' "^" RESULT-CLASS { "," RESULT } NL

`OUT-OF-BAND-RECORD ==>'
     ASYNC-RECORD `|' STREAM-RECORD

`ASYNC-RECORD ==>'
     EXEC-ASYNC-OUTPUT `|' STATUS-ASYNC-OUTPUT `|' NOTIFY-ASYNC-OUTPUT

`EXEC-ASYNC-OUTPUT ==>'
     `[' TOKEN `]' "*" ASYNC-OUTPUT

`STATUS-ASYNC-OUTPUT ==>'
     `[' TOKEN `]' "+" ASYNC-OUTPUT

`NOTIFY-ASYNC-OUTPUT ==>'
     `[' TOKEN `]' "=" ASYNC-OUTPUT

`ASYNC-OUTPUT ==>'
     ASYNC-CLASS { "," RESULT } NL

`RESULT-CLASS ==>'
     "done" `|' "running" `|' "connected" `|' "error" `|' "exit"

`ASYNC-CLASS ==>'
     "stopped" `|' *others depending on need as still in development*

`RESULT ==>'
     STRING "=" VALUE

`VALUE ==>'
     C-STRING `|' TUPPLE `|' LIST

`TUPPLE ==>'
     "{}" `|' "{" RESULT { "," RESULT } "}"

`LIST ==>'
     "`[]'" `|' "`['" VALUE { "," VALUE } "`]'"

`STRING ==>'
     *[-A-Za-z\.0-9_]**

`C-STRING ==>'
     *See the input specification*

`STREAM-RECORD ==>'
     CONSOLE-STREAM-OUTPUT `|' TARGET-STREAM-OUTPUT `|'
     LOG-STREAM-OUTPUT

`CONSOLE-STREAM-OUTPUT ==>'
     "~" C-STRING

`TARGET-STREAM-OUTPUT ==>'
     "@" C-STRING

`LOG-STREAM-OUTPUT ==>'
     "&" C-STRING

`NL ==>'
     CR `|' CR-LF

`TOKEN ==>'
     "any sequence of digits"

   In addition, the following are still being developed.

`QUERY'
     This action is currently undefined.

   Notes:

   * All output sequences end in a single line containing a period.

   * The `TOKEN' is from the corresponding request.  If an execution
     command is interrupted by the `-exec-interrupt' command, the token
     associated with the `*stopped' message is the one of the original
     execution command, not the one of the interrupt command.

   * STATUS-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains on-going status information about the
     progress of a slow operation.  It can be discarded.  All status
     output is prefixed by the prefix `+'.

   * EXEC-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains asynchronous state change on the target
     (stopped, started, disappeared).  All async output is prefixed by
     the prefix `*'.

   * NOTIFY-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains supplementary information that the
     client should handle (new breakpoint information).  All notify
     output is prefixed by the prefix `='.

   * CONSOLE-STREAM-OUTPUT is output that should be displayed as is, in
     the console.  It is the textual response to a CLI command.  All
     the console output is prefixed by the prefix `~'.

   * TARGET-STREAM-OUTPUT is the output produced by the target program.
     All the target output is prefixed by the prefix `@'.

   * LOG-STREAM-OUTPUT is output text coming from GDB's internals, for
     instance messages that should be displayed as part of an error
     log.  All the log output is prefixed by the prefix `&'.

Reporting Bugs in GDB
*********************

   Your bug reports play an essential role in making GDB reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of GDB work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GDB.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

Have you found a bug?
=====================

   If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the debugger gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a GDB bug.  Reliable debuggers never crash.

   * If GDB produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.
     (Note that if you're cross debugging, the problem may also be
     somewhere in the connection to the target.)

   * If GDB does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of debugging tools, your suggestions
     for improvement of GDB are welcome in any case.

How to report bugs
==================

   A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained GDB from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for GDB to
this addresses:

     bug-gdb@gnu.org

   *Do not send bug reports to `info-gdb', or to `help-gdb', or to any
newsgroups.*  Most users of GDB do not want to receive bug reports.
Those that do have arranged to receive `bug-gdb'.

   The mailing list `bug-gdb' has a newsgroup `gnu.gdb.bug' which
serves as a repeater.  The mailing list and the newsgroup carry exactly
the same messages.  Often people think of posting bug reports to the
newsgroup instead of mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one
problem which can be crucial: a newsgroup posting often lacks a mail
path back to the sender.  Thus, if we need to ask for more information,
we may be unable to reach you.  For this reason, it is better to send
bug reports to the mailing list.

   As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:

     GNU Debugger Bugs
     Free Software Foundation Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330
     Boston, MA 02111-1307
     USA

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not
matter.  Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps
the bug is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the
location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the debugger into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug.  It may be that the bug has been reported previously, but
neither you nor we can know that unless your bug report is complete and
self-contained.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to *refuse
to respond to them* except to chide the sender to report bugs properly.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of GDB.  GDB announces it if you start with no
     arguments; you can also print it at any time using `show version'.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of GDB.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile GDB--e.g.
     "gcc-2.8.1".

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile the program
     you are debugging--e.g.  "gcc-2.8.1", or "HP92453-01 A.10.32.03 HP
     C Compiler".  For GCC, you can say `gcc --version' to get this
     information; for other compilers, see the documentation for those
     compilers.

   * The command arguments you gave the compiler to compile your
     example and observe the bug.  For example, did you use `-O'?  To
     guarantee you will not omit something important, list them all.  A
     copy of the Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input script, and all necessary source files, that will
     reproduce the bug.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that GDB gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of GDB is out of synch, or you have encountered
     a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your
     copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a
     crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug
     was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to expect a
     crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
     observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the GDB source, send us context
     diffs.  If you even discuss something in the GDB source, refer to
     it by context, not by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report *instead*
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as GDB it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

Introduction to Line Editing
============================

   The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent
keystrokes.

   The text <C-k> is read as `Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the <k> key is pressed while the Control key is depressed.

   The text <M-k> is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <k>
key is pressed.  The Meta key is labeled <ALT> on many keyboards.  On
keyboards with two keys labeled <ALT> (usually to either side of the
space bar), the <ALT> on the left side is generally set to work as a
Meta key.  The <ALT> key on the right may also be configured to work as
a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a
Compose key for typing accented characters.

   If you do not have a Meta or <ALT> key, or another key working as a
Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <ESC>
first, and then typing <k>.  Either process is known as "metafying" the
<k> key.

   The text <M-C-k> is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by "metafying" <C-k>.

   In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
<DEL>, <ESC>, <LFD>, <SPC>, <RET>, and <TAB> all stand for themselves
when seen in this text, or in an init file (*note Readline Init
File::.).  If your keyboard lacks a <LFD> key, typing <C-j> will
produce the desired character.  The <RET> key may be labeled <Return>
or <Enter> on some keyboards.

Readline Interaction
====================

   Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <RETURN>.  You do not have to be at the end
of the line to press <RETURN>; the entire line is accepted regardless
of the location of the cursor within the line.

Readline Bare Essentials
------------------------

   In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The
typed character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves
one space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use your
erase character to back up and delete the mistyped character.

   Sometimes you may mistype a character, and not notice the error
until you have typed several other characters.  In that case, you can
type <C-b> to move the cursor to the left, and then correct your
mistake.  Afterwards, you can move the cursor to the right with <C-f>.

   When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that
characters to the right of the cursor are `pushed over' to make room
for the text that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text
behind the cursor, characters to the right of the cursor are `pulled
back' to fill in the blank space created by the removal of the text.  A
list of the bare essentials for editing the text of an input line
follows.

<C-b>
     Move back one character.

<C-f>
     Move forward one character.

<DEL> or <Backspace>
     Delete the character to the left of the cursor.

<C-d>
     Delete the character underneath the cursor.

Printing characters
     Insert the character into the line at the cursor.

<C-_> or <C-x C-u>
     Undo the last editing command.  You can undo all the way back to an
     empty line.

(Depending on your configuration, the <Backspace> key be set to delete
the character to the left of the cursor and the <DEL> key set to delete
the character underneath the cursor, like <C-d>, rather than the
character to the left of the cursor.)

Readline Movement Commands
--------------------------

   The above table describes the most basic keystrokes that you need in
order to do editing of the input line.  For your convenience, many
other commands have been added in addition to <C-b>, <C-f>, <C-d>, and
<DEL>.  Here are some commands for moving more rapidly about the line.

<C-a>
     Move to the start of the line.

<C-e>
     Move to the end of the line.

<M-f>
     Move forward a word, where a word is composed of letters and
     digits.

<M-b>
     Move backward a word.

<C-l>
     Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.

   Notice how <C-f> moves forward a character, while <M-f> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

Readline Killing Commands
-------------------------

   "Killing" text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by "yanking" (re-inserting) it back into
the line.  (`Cut' and `paste' are more recent jargon for `kill' and
`yank'.)

   If the description for a command says that it `kills' text, then you
can be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

   When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a "kill-ring".
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it all.  The kill ring is not line
specific; the text that you killed on a previously typed line is
available to be yanked back later, when you are typing another line.

   Here is the list of commands for killing text.

<C-k>
     Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the
     line.

<M-d>
     Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or, if between
     words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same
     as those used by <M-f>.

<M-DEL>
     Kill from the cursor the start of the previous word, or, if between
     words, to the start of the previous word.  Word boundaries are the
     same as those used by <M-b>.

<C-w>
     Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is
     different than <M-DEL> because the word boundaries differ.

   Here is how to "yank" the text back into the line.  Yanking means to
copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

<C-y>
     Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the
     cursor.

<M-y>
     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this
     if the prior command is <C-y> or <M-y>.

Readline Arguments
------------------

   You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the sign of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type `M-- C-k'.

   The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type
meta digits before the command.  If the first `digit' typed is a minus
sign (`-'), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once you
have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type the
remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give
the <C-d> command an argument of 10, you could type `M-1 0 C-d'.
