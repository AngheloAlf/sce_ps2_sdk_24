gstool Version 3.1 package for the DTL-T10000
=============================================

This package displays the "TOOL PlayStation 2" image and network configuration information
on the monitor when the DTL-T10000 is started up. When it is used with the DTL-T10000
Management Tool PStoolSetup (Ver. 1.3 or later), it also allows the MAC address of an
expansion PC Card to be checked from a Web browser.

Also, this package does not affect the operation of a user program.

gstool version 3.1 is the bug fix version of version 3.0. This package is compatible with
the t10000-rel240.bin kernel (included in "DTL-T10000 Runtime Library Release 2.4.0").
